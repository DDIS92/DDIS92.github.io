title: 5 Things to Remember When Analyzing Data
---


Whenever you have a project that involves data analysis, there are 5 steps (at minimum) that you should follow. These steps offer the foundation for any analyst to properly pick apart the data and produce reliable and valid results. In this blog, we will be using examples from a project that I was working on. The goal of this analysis was to try to determine what factors influenced average ranking numbers in the year 2000.

1.Define a Problem Statement: You should decide what you are trying to analyze. This should always be your first step in the project. Make sure that the question is defined via the SMART goals:

a.	Specificity: Specify as best as you can what you want to analyze. This will make it easier for you to come up with results. Here are some examples of implementing specificity when coming up with a problem statement:
  i.	Specify a particular relationship between variables that you want to test out. Alternatively, specify which variable you are trying to predict. 
  ii.	Specify which variables you are using as metrics. This includes the dependent variable (i.e. the variable that you are trying to predict/analyze) and the independent variables (i.e. the variables that you hypothesize are factors that influence the dependent variable).
  iii.	Specify the year that you wish to examine. This will give anyone reading your study some context.

b.	Measurability: You need to make sure that your answer can be quantified. This allows you to assess whether or not you can answer the question, and how well you have answered the question.
  
c.	Attainability: Can you attain all of the data that you need? Can you use the methods required to analyze and interpret the data?
  
d.	Reproducibility: Can your results be reproduced by someone else? 
  
e.	Time-Bound: Often, you do not have the freedom to work on your analysis forever. You need to meet deadlines. Can you complete your analysis in the given time period? 

2.Know What the Dataset Contains: Itâ€™s important to know what information your dataset has. Following this step allows you to:
  
a.	Focus on the most important variables. This is also part of step 3 (i.e cleaning the data).

b.	Understand the data types. This may or may not influence you to manipulate variables to best suit your needs. 

c.	Decide what methods of statistical analysis are practical in the given time frame. You cannot work on this data forever, so you have to find practical and meaningful methods of measuring data.

3.Clean the Data: Datasets are usually messy. Values might be missing, nonsensical, or vague. Therefore, datasets require lots of cleaning. This is a tedious, but necessary, process to ensure that your analysis goes smoothly. There are lots of ways to clean data. You can remove missing values, fill them with your own (provided that your values are not completely random guesses with no thought or logic behind them), or even obtain them from another trustworthy data source (again, it depends on the time allocated for your project). It is important to explain why you cleaned the data (or certain variables within the dataset), how you cleaned it and why you cleaned it the way you did.

(show a subset of data here; NaNs, some inconsistencies with the data (float and int), etc.

4.Plot Graphs, Tables and Charts: Visualizations help show patterns in the data and convey a lot of information without being unnecessarily complicated. Keep in mind that these visualizations are subject to how you manipulate your variables. Remember to state your assumptions when presenting data to make sure that you do not mislead anyone looking at the graph.

5.Decide Which Method(s) of Higher Level Analysis You Are Going to Use: There are a lot of higher level methods of analysis (e.g. regression models, hypothesis testing, normalization tests, etc.). However, these should be implemented once you understand what you want to test and know which variables to test. These should be considered after you have done all of the other steps as it is simply a matter of deciding which one to use based on the cleaned data.

That's all for today. I hope that this gave you a better understand as to how to approach a project involving data analysis.
